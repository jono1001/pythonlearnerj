However my guide is aimed at getting students coding ASAP. These are my TL:DR type of guides.  Here are some sample screenshots.</p>\n<p>I find that these style of guides are well received by my students. I think the idea is to get them programming and then I would explain/discuss with them the programmes features and terminology. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"   >\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://jono1001.github.io/pythonlearnerj/media/posts/2/gallery/Screenshot_1.png\" ><img src=\"https://jono1001.github.io/pythonlearnerj/media/posts/2/gallery/Screenshot_1-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"MainPage\" width=\"720\" height=\"406\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">Main Page</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://jono1001.github.io/pythonlearnerj/media/posts/2/gallery/Screenshot_2.png\" ><img src=\"https://jono1001.github.io/pythonlearnerj/media/posts/2/gallery/Screenshot_2-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"LessonObjectives\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">Lesson Objectives</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://jono1001.github.io/pythonlearnerj/media/posts/2/gallery/Screenshot_3.png\" ><img src=\"https://jono1001.github.io/pythonlearnerj/media/posts/2/gallery/Screenshot_3-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"Sample Programme Circle\" width=\"720\" height=\"406\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">Sample Programme Circle</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://jono1001.github.io/pythonlearnerj/media/posts/2/gallery/Screenshot_4.png\" ><img src=\"https://jono1001.github.io/pythonlearnerj/media/posts/2/gallery/Screenshot_4-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"Sample Programme Tangent Circles\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a></figure>\n</div>",

I still have students who are very interesting in doing this. My goal is to be a better programmer so my students benefit. </p>\n<p>Everyday I read Reddit posts about learning programming. I like to lurk here and often pick up on what is important when learning programming languges. I also like to be part of this community.</p>\n<p>This is a great hobby that has replaced another <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">adiction</span> hobby. I don't have aspirations to be a programmer that is paid for their time coding. I would like this but can't see it happening. Therefore I can take my time to learn and teach myself this new skill. </p>\n<p>I work online teaching students Computer Science. I have a lot of downtime between lesson and I plan to use this time to learn coding. As a result I can use my freetime everyday to learn something about coding and programming. </p>\n<p>These are my broad aims and goals What do you think so far?</p>",
